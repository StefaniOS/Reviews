This repository includes three different projects with a different architecutural approach for each.

The first project is a classic List application based on UITableView and MVC pattern.

The second project is very similar to the first one but instead of MVC, it uses MVVM pattern. For the networking I use Alamofire here.

Finally, the third project is based on MVVM and RxSwift patterns. This is a pure swift application, so the UI is also implemented with code only, wihtout using storyboards. For Dependency Injection I've used "Service Locator Pattern", which I've modified a little and implemented in more "swifty" way.

IMPORTANT! The goal of these projects is to provide different architectural solutions for a single idea. These are not final projects and may include some TODO's for future experiments. Since the idea was to keep the code as simple (stupid :)) as possible and easy to understand, I haven't focused much on design, tests, imges, features etc.

Any suggestions, comments, ideas are welcome!

Enjoy!
